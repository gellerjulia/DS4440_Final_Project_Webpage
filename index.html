<h2>An Analysis of “Brain Tumor Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network”</h2>
<p>Describe the paper and the big question about it that interests you.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The goal of our project is to create a Neural Network that can classify if an MRI brain image was either healthy, contained a glioma tumor, contained a meningioma tumor, or contained a pituitary tumor. We based our approach off of the publication “Brain Tumor Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network” by Abiwinanda et. al. The publication we used successfully built a model that classified tumor images as one of the three aforementioned tumors, but we wanted to extend the capabilities to also distinguish between tumor and healthy brain scans so the model could fulfill a wider array of physician needs. 
</p>



<h2>About the Data</h2>

<p>The data used in this project is a combination of two datasets, referred to as fig share and  SARTAJ. Fig share is the data used in the original paper. This data includes T1-weighted MRI brain images for patients with one of three types of tumors: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary. SARTAJ is a Kaggle dataset with MRI brain images of patients with one of the aforementioned tumor types and healthy patients. In our project, we only use the brain images of healthy patients from this dataset. Both datasets had grayscale images. Fig share images were mainly sized 512x512 while SARTAJ images were mainly size 233x236, though there was variation in each dataset. All images were resized to 64x64 and 128x128 images. The varying sizes were tested in an attempt to achieve increased model performance, however, models trained on the 128x128 sized images had worse accuracy so we only trained models on images resized to be 64x64 pixels. </p>

<p> We test two splits of data: balanced and imbalanced. The balanced split consists of 500 train, 100 validation, and 100 test images for each tumor and 219 train, 50 validation, and 50 test images for the healthy class. A smaller validation and test set was used for the healthy class as this class consisted of fewer images and we wanted to retain as many images as possible for training. The imbalanced split was created to inflate the number of training samples for the glioma class as it was observed that this class was the class with the largest proportion of incorrect predictions. Imbalanced data had the above-stated splits for all classes, except the glioma class which had 836 train, 50 validation, and 50 test images.

<h2>Models</h2>

<p> We compared the original model to an adjsuted model we created.
